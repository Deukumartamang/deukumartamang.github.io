    I like watching anime when I have free time. My all-time favourite anime is One
   <br>
    piece it’s basically about pirates and Government and it’s adventures anime with
    <br>
    more than thousand episode and it’s a very long anime it almost took me two month 
    <br>
    to watch it . Monkey D. Luffy is the main character in this anime. There are many
    <br>
    more anime that I like such as attack on titan, Black clover, Naruto, Jujutsu Kaisen,
    <br>
    my hero academic, fire force, I want to eat your pancreas, howl’s moving castle and so on.

    hi! guys this is my second term  of my college and we are
    <br>
    doing networking and here are some of the practical things we have done.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="container">

<div class="container photo2">
    <img src="rj45.jpg" alt="after how it looks like">
</div>
<div class="container photo3">
    <img src="tester.jpg" alt="now testing the cable">
</div>
<div class="container photo4">
    <img src="cate5e.jpg" alt="another wire">
</div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<P>
    To make the cat5e you need a cable does not matter how long it is. And you 
    <br>
    need to strip the outer PVC plastic. The wire inside the cable is twisted to 
    <br> 
    each other you need to separate them and straighten. To straighten them it is
    <br>
     the hardest part in the whole to make cat5e, your hand will be numb for couple 
     <br>
     of minutes, but you will be fine. After that is how it looks like.
</P>
<br>
<p>
    After that you must order your wire on this basis. After you have done that,
    <br>
     now you need a wire cutter to cut the wire to make it small, but it should be
     <br>
      in order as well now you need a RJ45 crimp, boot, and a jack.
</p>
<br>
<div class="cat5e cable">
<P>
Now you have to insert the wire into the RJ45 jack. And check whether it is in correct 
<br>
order or not because once you have squeezed RJ45jack with the help of crimp you cannot
<br>
used that again Now once you have inserted the wire in correct order, now you need a R745 crimp to help
<br>
squeezed or compress the connector. After you have done that your connector should be look 
<br>
like this« And you must do that other way around Aswell so that it looks exactly like the
<br>
picture above, but do not forget to the RJ45 boot.For the last part now, you need a cable tester,
<br>
 and you must insert both end to a cable tester. If your cable shows all green without skipping
 <br>
 any of the light, then itis meant your cable is good to use hooray you have done it
