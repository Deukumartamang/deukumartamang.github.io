    I like watching anime when I have free time. My all-time favourite anime is One
   <br>
    piece it’s basically about pirates and Government and it’s adventures anime with
    <br>
    more than thousand episode and it’s a very long anime it almost took me two month 
    <br>
    to watch it . Monkey D. Luffy is the main character in this anime. There are many
    <br>
    more anime that I like such as attack on titan, Black clover, Naruto, Jujutsu Kaisen,
    <br>
    my hero academic, fire force, I want to eat your pancreas, howl’s moving castle and so on.
